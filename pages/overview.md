# Overview: Who Are the Patentees and Why They Came to Sweden
## Background
After the Meiji Restoration, Japan started to explore its way of modernization and industrialization. The country established its patent system in 1885, in order to protect and promote domestic innovation. Foreigners were excluded from the system and not allowed to register their inventions until 1899, when Japan acceded to the Paris Convention. Joining the international agreement not only opened the door for foreign patentees, but also helps Japanese creators to protect their intellectual works globally. Since then, Japanese inventors have been engaged in patenting activity in various countries.

Japanese merchants were interested in developing their own  business aboard when seeing the western capital entered Japan market. Though not as important as the UK and America, their primary Scandinavian destination is Sweden. The relationship between Sweden and Japan can be traced back to the second half of nineteenth century, and the trade between these two countries kept growing in the following century. As Sweden's most important export market in the Far East, Japan also tried to expand its exports in Sweden. Applying patents in the Swedish system can be regarded as part of Japan's oversea commercial strategy. 
## Patents
From 1894 to 1938, 36 Japanese patentees received 56 patents in Sweden. The amount of patents increased steadily per decade. Almost half of the patents were applied and granted during the 1930s. Although the number of patents is comparatively small, their quality is remarkable -- many patents are award-winning in Japan and aboard, and they were validate for about 7.13 years on average. Since the patent need to be renewed each year with a tiered price, a longer duration usually indicates a higher estimation of quality. 

The patent officer identifies a patent class code for each application. The dominant category in these patents are electrical engineering, Ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, net-making and chemical related items. It is interesting to compare with the Japanese domestic data: while chemistry and meallurgy, as well as electrical engineering are also of great significance, the inventions traveling to Sweden may still either have a higher added value or fit extremely well with the local need.
## Patentees
The first Japanese resident in Swedish record is Wilhelm van der Heyden. He is a medical doctor from Netherlands who lived and worked in Yokohama. van der Heyden's patent for a dwelling composed of glass boxes was granted in 1894. Fifteen years after, the first patent from a Japanese citizen appeared: Keiichiro Okazaki and Hanuemon Yenjo, both from Tokyo, patent their method of producing nitrogenous digestive food.

More than half of the patentees (ca. 64%) have only one patent in Sweden, and the patentees with the most patents are Yoshito Watanabe and Takeo Miyaguchi, who both have four different patents.

The patentees can be divided into three types: most of them are individuals, and there are also companies and research institutions. For those individuals, they are all male and nearly two third of them are engineer. However, the situation is probably more complex than the data from registration books suggest. Japanese social elites were often involved in various fields at that period. Many engineers also taught at the higher education institution and some professors had their own business.

In 1930s, patents applied by multinational corporations has appeared. Two different types can be found: foreign inventors working for Japanese international company, and Japanese engineer in foreign firms. This indicates an openness of Japanese economy and the competence of its talents.
## Patent Agent
As the 1885 Swedish Patent Law states, all the applicators living outside Sweden must have a Swedish citizen as their agent. The patent agency had been active in the whole twentieth century. For Japanese inventors, a local intermediator is essential also because they seldom have the language skill to provide required documents in Swedish. In addition, the agent is more familiar with the local regulation and assists them to handle practical issues on time despite long distance, such as the yearly renewal payment.

Several different agents have their own Japanese customer. The top three agents with highest market share are Anders Wilhelm Anderson, Axel Emmanuel Hasselrot and Harry Fredrik Albihn. Anderson is an engineer who founded the patent agency AWA in 1897. He was mainly active in 1920s and had most clients at that decade. Meanwhile, Hasselrot is a lawyer who established his own agency in 1924 after working for Swedish patent office (PRV) for more than ten years. He became the core of Japanese patentees local network in 1930s. And Albihn was employed at one of the leading patent office, Theodor Wawrinsky's since 1903. He was promoted as the co-owner and finally became the sole owner of the agency in 1920. He was also involved in many Japanese's patent application.

There is little evidence about how they got in touch with their Japanese clients. Although patent agents had rather divergent background, the data demonstrates that they had no preference or specialization in certain patent class. Specialists from other countries of Europe could also facilitate the connection between Japanese inventors and Swedish agents, yet more evidence is needed to reconstruct the transnational network. Besides, a group of Japanese patent agencies who helps patenting overseas emerged at the beginning of twentieth century. They might also have played a role in paving the way to Sweden.
## Why Sweden
An intuitive question to ask is why these Japanese took the trouble of filing a patent in Sweden. My answer remains preliminary before diving deeper into individual cases and finding detailed archives. 

For a patentee, the predominating motivation of filing patent is to make profit from his or her invention. Though no direct patent transfer can be found in the registration book, some patentees likely attempted to tap into the Swedish market. An example is Japanese net-making machine. The high share of this class in the dataset indicates Japanese may have stepped into Swedish net-making industry from 1920s. As accounted in Imperial Inventor Directory (1937), Senichi Hiroi who held a net-making machine patent in Japan, exported his machine into several major fishery producing countries including Sweden. 

Generally speaking, Japanese export to Sweden remained a low amount in the first half of twentieth century. More often than not, patentees' attempt to expand into Swedish market met with little success. Keiichiro Okazaki and Hanuemon Yenjo, the very first Japanese citizens holding a patent in Sweden, tried to sell their newly invented digestive, *Digestin*, in the global market. They achieved an overall triumph overseas especially after participating the Japan-British Exhibition in 1910. Yenjo's pharmaceutical company exported over one million pills per year and constructing a huge international agent network in late 1910s. However, no Swedish partner is recorded in their archive and the patent expired in 1912.

Nevertheless, another profit model harder to trace is to charge patent license fee. By granting the license to a third party, the patentee manages to enjoy a sustainable income as long as the patent lasts. A famous case is the *Zaidan Hojin Rikagaku Kenkyujo* (Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Riken). Riken is a large scientific research institution whose funding comes mainly from patent license fee. It held three Swedish patent before World War II, one of which is the method to extract fat-soluble vitamin, i.e. vitamin A (1923). The leader of the institution hoped to commercialize outcomes of applied scientific research using international patenting activity. The vitamin A patent is  the first and greatest success of such strategy. By selling and licensing the patent worldwide, Riken tripled its revenues and created a solid financial base independent from government funding. 

Another benefit goes side by side with economical profit is the protection of crucial technological innovation. The patent system is originally designed to ensure the intellectual property rights of the inventor. Some Japanese inventors may consider their oversea patenting activity mostly as a precautionary measure. Kotaro Honda registered four different permanent magnet patents in Sweden. (The patentee of first two is a company, Sumitomo Chukosho Ltd., and the latter is *Kinzoku Zairyo Kenkyusho* (Institute for Materials Research of Tohoku University) found by him in 1919.) He held these patents from 1918 to 1944, marking his leading position in international academic competence. On the other hand, details revealing for patenting can lead to the leakage of edge-cutting technology, thus affecting the potential commercial benefit. Therefore, the casting methods of his KS and new KS steel are only briefly described in the patent documents.

For Japanese patentees, the endeavor to expand foreign market did not always bring positive results, but the time and money spent for patenting overseas still partly paid off most times. Receiving patents of their products in Sweden demonstrates a legitimacy and innovativeness recognized by a western government. It means a lot in a developing country longing for westernization and catching up in industry. "Patented" had became a popular catchphrase in advertisement since the establishment of Japanese patent system. Japanese businessmen quickly realized that promotional slogans highlighting how many foreign patents their products had been granted would create an impression of innovation, modernity and efficiency. It also echoed the nation's eagerness to achieve world-class in science and technology. Many advertisement claimed a high number of countries the product had been patented, even though some of them already expired.
